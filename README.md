## Overview

This project was developed as part of a neuromorphic computing course at CentraleSupélec. It implements a fast, quantized simulation of a photonic-inspired reservoir using NumPy, and explores:

- Stability and divergence using pseudo-Lyapunov curves  
- Convergence speed under leaky integration  
- MNIST classification using raw and HOG features  
- Hyperparameter optimization (γ, I₀, μ) via Bayesian methods  
- End-to-end benchmarking with a ridge regression readout  

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/Paul92150/photonic-reservoir.git  
cd photonic-reservoir  
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running Experiments

All experiments are located in the `experiments/` folder.  
To run any of them, use the following command from the root of the project:

python experiments/05_leaky_convergence_analysis.py

### Experiment Highlights

File                                | Description
------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------
02_stability_divergence_curves.py  | Pseudo-Lyapunov divergence over time  
04_stability_heatmap.py            | Heatmap of max divergence vs (γ, I₀)  
05_leaky_convergence_analysis.py   | Convergence time analysis with leaky integration  
06_mnist_first_results.py          | MNIST classification with raw / HOG features  
07_optuna_mnist_hog.py             | Bayesian optimization of reservoir parameters  
08_hog_gamma_I0_bayopt.py          | Joint HOG + reservoir hyperparameter search  

## Results

- 98.86% test accuracy on MNIST (HOG + tuned reservoir with 8000 neurons)  
- Leaky integration improves convergence times (α ≈ 0.4–0.7 optimal)  
- Clear stability-chaos transitions observed in divergence plots  

See full results and discussion in `report/report.pdf`.

## Key Features

- Fully quantized model (inner & outer bit-depth, clippings)  
- Reservoir size customizable from 256 to 8000+  
- Supports one-shot (`transform`) and temporal (`simulate_series`) dynamics  
- Compatible with Optuna for full pipeline optimization  
- Lightweight and fast: built with NumPy, scikit-learn, scikit-image

## Summary (Non-Technical)

This project simulates how a brain-like wave-based system processes images.  
It mimics photonic reservoirs (light-based neural networks) using a digital simulation.  
The goal is to explore their behavior and test their ability to recognize handwritten digits (MNIST).  
Despite its simplicity, the model reaches nearly 99% accuracy and exhibits fascinating properties like memory, chaos, and stability.
